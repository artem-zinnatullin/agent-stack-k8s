# Buildkite Agent Stack for Kubernetes

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/d58c90abfe8b48f8d8750dac8e911fc0b6afe026631b4dc97c.svg?branch=main)](https://buildkite.com/buildkite-kubernetes-stack/kubernetes-agent-stack)

## Overview

A Kubernetes controller that runs [Buildkite steps](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/defining-steps) as [Kubernetes jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/).

## Installation

### Requirements

- A Kubernetes cluster
- An API token with the [GraphQL scope enabled](https://buildkite.com/docs/apis/graphql-api#authentication)
- An [agent token](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/tokens)

### Deploy with Helm

The simplest way to get up and running is by deploying our [Helm](https://helm.sh) chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install agent-stack-k8s oci://ghcr.io/buildkite/helm/agent-stack-k8s \
    --create-namespace \
    --namespace buildkite \
    --set config.org=<your Buildkite org slug> \
    --set agentToken=<your Buildkite agent token> \
    --set graphqlToken=<your Buildkite GraphQL-enabled API token>
```

We're using Helm's support for [OCI-based registries](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/),
which means you'll need Helm version 3.8.0 or newer.

This will create an agent-stack-k8s installation that will listen to the `kubernetes` queue.
See the `--tags` [option](#Options) for specifying a different queue.

#### Externalize Secrets

You can also have an external provider create a secret for you in the namespace before deploying the chart with helm. If the secret is pre-provisioned, replace the `agentToken` and `graphqlToken` arguments with:

```bash
--set agentStackSecret=<secret-name>
```

The format of the required secret can be found in [this file](./charts/agent-stack-k8s/templates/secrets.yaml.tpl).

#### Other Installation Methods

You can also use this chart as a dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
- name: agent-stack-k8s
  version: "0.5.0"
  repository: "oci://ghcr.io/buildkite/helm"
```

or use it as a template:

```
helm template oci://ghcr.io/buildkite/helm/agent-stack-k8s -f my-values.yaml
```

Available versions and their digests can be found on [the releases page](https://github.com/buildkite/agent-stack-k8s/releases).

```

Configuration can also be provided by a config file (`--config` or `CONFIG`), or environment variables. In the [examples](examples) folder there is a sample [YAML config](examples/config.yaml) and a sample [dotenv config](examples/config.env).

### Sample Buildkite Pipelines
For simple commands, you merely have to target the queue you configured agent-stack-k8s with.
```yaml
steps:
- label: Hello World!
  command: echo Hello World!
  agents:
    queue: kubernetes
```
For more complicated steps, you have access to the [`PodSpec`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.29/#podspec-v1-core) Kubernetes API resource that will be used in a Kubernetes [`Job`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.29/#job-v1-batch).
For now, this is nested under a `kubernetes` plugin.
But unlike other Buildkite plugins, there is no corresponding plugin repository.
Rather, this is syntax that is interpreted by the `agent-stack-k8s` controller.
```yaml
steps:
- label: Hello World!
  agents:
    queue: kubernetes
  plugins:
  - kubernetes:
      podSpec:
        containers:
        - image: alpine:latest
          command:
          - echo
          - Hello World!
```
Note that in a `podSpec`, a `command` should be YAML list that will be combined into a single command for a container to run.

Almost any container image may be used, but it MUST have a POSIX shell available to be executed at `/bin/sh`.

It's also possible to specify an entire script as a `command`
```yaml
steps:
- label: Hello World!
  agents:
    queue: kubernetes
  plugins:
  - kubernetes:
      podSpec:
        containers:
        - image: alpine:latest
          command:
          - |-
            set -euo pipefail

            echo Hello World! > hello.txt
            cat hello.txt | buildkite-agent annotate
```
If you have a multi-line `command`, specifying the `args` as well could lead to confusion, so we recommend just using `command`.

More samples can be found in the [integration test fixtures directory](internal/integration/fixtures).

### Pod Spec Patch
Rather than defining the entire Pod Spec in a step, there is the option to define a [strategic merge patch](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/) in the controller.
Agent Stack K8s will first generate a K8s Job with a PodSpec from a Buildkite Job and then apply the patch in the controller.
It will then apply the patch specified in its config file, which is derived from the value in the helm installation.
This can replace much of the functionality of some of the other fields in the plugin, like `gitEnvFrom`.

#### Eliminate `gitEnvFrom`
Here's an example demonstrating how one would eliminate the need to specify `gitEnvFrom` from every step, but still checkout private repositories.

First, deploy the helm chart with a `values.yaml` file.
```yaml
# values.yaml
agentStackSecret: <name of predefined secrets for k8s>
config:
  org: <your-org-slug>
  pod-spec-patch:
    containers:
    - name: checkout         # <---- this is needed so that the secret will only be mounted on the checkout container
      envFrom:
      - secretRef:
          name: git-checkout # <---- this is the same secret name you would have put in `gitEnvFrom` in the kubernetes plugin
```
You may use the `-f` or `--values` arguments to `helm upgrade` to specify a `values.yaml` file.
```shell
helm upgrade --install agent-stack-k8s oci://ghcr.io/buildkite/helm/agent-stack-k8s \
    --create-namespace \
    --namespace buildkite \
    --values values.yaml \
    --version <agent-stack-k8s version>
```

Now, with this setup, we don't even need to specify the `kubernetes` plugin to use Agent Stack K8s with a private repo
```yaml
# pipelines.yaml
agents:
  queue: kubernetes
steps:
- name: Hello World!
  commands:
  - echo -n Hello!
  - echo " World!"

- name: Hello World in one command
  command: |-
    echo -n Hello!
    echo " World!"
```

#### Custom Images
You can specify a different image to use for a step in a step level `podSpecPatch`. Previously this could be done with a step level `podSpec`.
```yaml
# pipelines.yaml
agents:
  queue: kubernetes
steps:
- name: Hello World!
  commands:
  - echo -n Hello!
  - echo " World!"
  plugins:
  - kubernetes:
      podSpecPatch:
      - name: container-0
        image: alpine:latest

- name: Hello World from alpine!
  commands:
  - echo -n Hello
  - echo " from alpine!"
  plugins:
  - kubernetes:
      podSpecPatch:
      - name: container-0      # <---- You must specify this as exactly `container-0` for now.
        image: alpine:latest   #       We are experimenting with ways to make it more ergonomic
```

#### Default Resources
In the helm values, you can specify default resources to be used by the containers in Pods that are launched to run Jobs.
```yaml
# values.yaml
agentStackSecret: <name of predefend secrets for k8s>
config:
  org: <your-org-slug>
  pod-spec-patch:
    initContainers:
    - name: copy-agent
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 50Mi
    limits:
      memory: 100Mi
    containers:
    - name: agent          # this container acquires the job
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 50Mi
        limits:
          memory: 1Gi
    - name: checkout       # this container clones the repo
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 50Mi
        limits:
          memory: 1Gi
    - name: container-0    # the job runs in a container with this name by default
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 50Mi
        limits:
          memory: 1Gi
```
and then every job that's handled by this installation of agent-stack-k8s will default to these values. To override it for a step, use a step level `podSpecPatch`.
```yaml
# pipelines.yaml
agents:
  queue: kubernetes
steps:
- name: Hello from a container with more resources
  command: echo Hello World!
  plugins:
  - kubernetes:
      podSpecPatch:
        containers:
        - name: container-0    # <---- You must specify this as exactly `container-0` for now.
          resources:           #       We are experimenting with ways to make it more ergonomic
            requests:
              cpu: 1000m
              memory: 50Mi
            limits:
              memory: 1Gi

- name: Hello from a container with default resources
  command: echo Hello World!
```

### Buildkite Clusters
If you are using [Buildkite Clusters](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/clusters) to isolate sets of pipelines from each other, you will need to specify the cluster's UUID in the configuration for the controller. This may be done using a flag on the `helm` command like so: `--set config.cluster-uuid=<your cluster's UUID>`, or an entry in a values file.
```yaml
# values.yaml
config:
  cluster-uuid: beefcafe-abbe-baba-abba-deedcedecade
```
The cluster's UUID may be obtained by navigating to the [clusters page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/clusters), clicking on the relevant cluster and then clicking on "Settings". It will be in a section titled "GraphQL API Integration".

### Sidecars

Sidecar containers can be added to your job by specifying them under the top-level `sidecars` key. See [this example](internal/integration/fixtures/sidecars.yaml) for a simple job that runs `nginx` as a sidecar, and accesses the nginx server from the main job.

There is no guarantee that your sidecars will have started before your job, so using retries or a tool like [wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it) is a good idea to avoid flaky tests.

### Extra volume mounts

In some situations, for example if you want to use [git mirrors](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3#promoted-experiments-git-mirrors) you may want to attach extra volume mounts (in addition to the `/workspace` one) in all the pod containers.

See [this example](internal/integration/fixtures/extra-volume-mounts.yaml), that will declare a new volume in the `podSpec` and mount it in all the containers. The benefit, is to have the same mounted path in all containers, including the `checkout` container.

### Skipping checkout

For some steps, you may wish to avoid checkout (cloning a source repository).
This can be done with the `checkout` block under the `kubernetes` plugin:

```yaml
steps:
- label: Hello World!
  agents:
    queue: kubernetes
  plugins:
  - kubernetes:
      checkout:
        skip: true # prevents scheduling the checkout container
```

### Overriding flags for git clone/fetch

`git clone` and `git fetch` flags can be overridden per-step (similar to `BUILDKITE_GIT_CLONE_FLAGS` and `BUILDLKITE_GIT_FETCH_FLAGS` env vars) with the `checkout` block also:

```yaml
steps:
- label: Hello World!
  agents:
    queue: kubernetes
  plugins:
  - kubernetes:
      checkout:
        cloneFlags: -v --depth 1
        fetchFlags: -v --prune --tags
```


### Validating your pipeline

With the unstructured nature of Buildkite plugin specs, it can be frustratingly
easy to mess up your configuration and then have to debug why your agent pods are failing to start.
To help prevent this sort of error, there's a linter that uses [JSON
schema](https://json-schema.org/) to validate the pipeline and plugin
configuration.

This currently can't prevent every sort of error, you might still have a reference to a Kubernetes volume that doesn't exist, or other errors of that sort, but it will validate that the fields match the API spec we expect.

Our JSON schema can also be used with editors that support JSON Schema by configuring your editor to validate against the schema found [here](./cmd/linter/schema.json).

### Cloning repos via SSH

To use SSH to clone your repos, you'll need to add a secret reference via an [EnvFrom](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.25/#envfromsource-v1-core) to your pipeline to specify where to mount your SSH private key from.
Place this object under a `gitEnvFrom` key in the `kubernetes` plugin (see the example below).

You should create a secret in your namespace with an environment variable name that's recognised by [`docker-ssh-env-config`](https://github.com/buildkite/docker-ssh-env-config).
A script from this project is included in the default entrypoint of the default [`buildkite/agent`](https://hub.docker.com/r/buildkite/agent) Docker image.
It will process the value of the secret and write out a private key to the `~/.ssh` directory of the checkout container.

However this key will not be available in your job containers.
If you need to use git ssh credentials in your job containers, we recommend one of the following options:
1. Use a container image that's based on the default `buildkite/agent` docker image and preserve the default entrypoint by not overriding the command in the job spec.
2. Include or reproduce the functionality of the [`ssh-env-config.sh`](https://github.com/buildkite/docker-ssh-env-config/blob/-/ssh-env-config.sh) script in the entrypoint for your job container image

#### Example secret creation for ssh cloning
You most likely want to use a more secure method of managing k8s secrets. This example is illustrative only.

Supposing a SSH private key has been created and its public key has been registered with the remote repository provider (e.g. [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)).
```bash
kubectl create secret generic my-git-ssh-credentials --from-file=SSH_PRIVATE_DSA_KEY="$HOME/.ssh/id_ecdsa"
```

Then the following pipeline will be able to clone a git repository that requires ssh credentials.
```yaml
steps:
  - label: build image
    agents:
      queue: kubernetes
    plugins:
      - kubernetes:
          gitEnvFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: my-git-ssh-credentials # <----
          podSpec:
            containers:
              - image: gradle:latest
                command: [gradle]
                args:
                  - jib
                  - --image=ttl.sh/example:1h
```

## How does it work

The controller uses the [Buildkite GraphQL API](https://buildkite.com/docs/apis/graphql-api) to watch for scheduled work that uses the `kubernetes` plugin.

When a job is available, the controller will create a pod to acquire and run the job. It converts the [PodSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.25/#podspec-v1-core) in the `kubernetes` plugin into a pod by:

- adding an init container to:
  - copy the agent binary onto the workspace volume
- adding a container to run the buildkite agent
- adding a container to clone the source repository
- modifying the user-specified containers to:
  - overwrite the entrypoint to the agent binary
  - run with the working directory set to the workspace

The entrypoint rewriting and ordering logic is heavily inspired by [the approach used in Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/933e4f667c19eaf0a18a19557f434dbabe20d063/docs/developers/README.md#entrypoint-rewriting-and-step-ordering).

## Debugging
Use the `log-collector` script in the `utils` folder to collect logs for agent-stack-k8s.

### Prerequisites

- kubectl binary
- kubectl setup and authenticated to correct k8s cluster

### Inputs to the script

k8s namespace where you deployed agent stack k8s and where you expect their k8s jobs to run.

Buildkite job id for which you saw issues.

### Data/logs gathered:

The script will collect kubectl describe of k8s job, pod and agent stack k8s controller pod.

It will also capture kubectl logs of k8s pod for the Buildkite job, agent stack k8s controller pod and package them in a
tar archive which you can send via email to support@buildkite.com.

## Open questions

- How to deal with stuck jobs? Timeouts?
- How to deal with pod failures (not job failures)?
  - Report failure to buildkite from controller?
  - Emit pod logs to buildkite? If agent isn't starting correctly
  - Retry?
